# SprayProvisions
Simple Provision app using Spray

THis is a simple application to manage provisions, and it is based on Spray Framwork.
Code/Workflow has been copied from this tutorial https://danielasfregola.com/2015/02/23/how-to-build-a-rest-api-with-spray/ (many thanks!), but has been enhanced by using Slick as well as writing couple of unit tests.
